# Azure Databricks Deployment Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying Azure Databricks using Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. Follow the steps below to deploy various Azure resources and set up your Databricks environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites met before starting the deployment:

- **Terraform**: Make sure Terraform is installed on your machine. It is the key tool we'll use for deploying the resources.
- **Azure CLI**: Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) must be installed to interact with Azure resources directly from your terminal.
- **Azure Account**: You'll need an Azure account. A free plan suffices for this tutorial.

## Main Resources to Deploy

The deployment process will create and configure the following resources in Azure:

- Azure Resource Group
- Azure Storage Account
- Azure Service Principal
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Databricks Workspace
- Databricks Cluster

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### 1. Azure CLI Login

Before deploying any resources with Terraform, authenticate to Azure Cloud:

\```shell
az login
\```

### 2. Terraform Project Setup

Create a new folder named `databricks` in your preferred location and include the following files:

- `main.tf`
- `providers.tf`
- `variables.tf`

### 3. Terraform Providers

The Terraform providers `azurerm`, `databricks`, `azuread`, and `time` are utilized in this setup to interact with the Azure ecosystem effectively.

### 4. Terraform Initialization

Initialize Terraform to prepare your working directory and load the necessary providers:

\```shell
cd path/to/databricks
terraform init
\```

### 5. Terraform Plan

Preview the infrastructure changes with the `terraform plan` command to ensure the configurations are as expected:

\```shell
terraform plan
\```

### 6. Terraform Apply

Apply the Terraform configurations to create and configure the Azure resources:

\```shell
terraform apply
\```

## Conclusion

After executing these steps, your Azure Databricks environment will be set up and ready for use. This guide ensures a structured approach to deploying Azure resources, making your infrastructure management more efficient and reproducible.
